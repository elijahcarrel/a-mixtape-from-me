# General Front-End Rules

### Miscellaneous Tips
- Avoid using `@ts-nocheck`, `@ts-ignore`, etc. If you do need to leave those statements, leave a code comment explaining why, and explain to me in your agent response that you have added those code smells.

### Code Quality Workflow

- **Type Checking**: Run `npm run frontend-typecheck` to verify TypeScript types
- **Linting**: Run `npm run frontend-lint-fix` to fix ESLint issues
- **Formatting**: Run `npm run frontend-format-fix` to ensure consistent code style
